How’s our Austin market doing?&nbsp;

Now that we’re into March of 2020, it’s doing really well in general. Inventory is low in many places, but it also depends on where you live. Different things are happening in different areas. If you’d like to know what’s happening in your ZIP code, **you can use**[**this online tool**](https://altos.re/r/6dc6975?fbrefresh=true) **I’ve invested in that will provide you a specific market report.**&nbsp;

More and more multiple-offer situations have been popping up as well. I even witnessed a bidding war recently for a home I felt was overpriced. This shows that now is a great time to sell your home.&nbsp;

If you’re ready to sell or would like to know more about what’s going on in your neck of the woods, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;
