{% include youtube.html %}2019 is coming to an end, which means it’s time to write down your goals for 2020.&nbsp;

With 2019 coming to an end and the holiday season well underway, I wanted to reach out to you today and wish you a happy holiday. I hope you enjoy spending time with your loved ones.&nbsp;

I also want to remind you that **now is the time to think about your goals for 2020.** As you think about them, write them down. I am currently in the process of writing down my goals for 2020.&nbsp;

As a homeowner, for example, you may have goals focusing on what you want to do to your house. Maybe your goal is to move up, or downsize into a different home. You may even want to buy an investment property. In any case, write them down, and after that, I invite you to share them with me. I’d love to see if I can help you accomplish your 2020 goals.&nbsp;

In the meantime, **stay tuned for my next video blog where I’ll share my specific goals for next year.** 2019 was an interesting year, but it’s time to start setting goals for 2020.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any real estate questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;
