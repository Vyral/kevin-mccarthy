  about_markdown: |
    As a native Austinite, Kevin brings local knowledge to a whole new level. Brought up in the small business world he has connections in all corners of Austin. Kevin grew up in the well known central Austin neighborhood of Hyde Park across the street from Hancock golf course.

    Kevin started working at the family business in West Austin at 13 years old and started his first business venture at the age of 17. Since then Kevin has started and sold off a handful of small businesses. Fascinated by Real Estate, Kevin bought a house in NW Austin as soon as he was old enough for a bank to consider giving him a mortgage. He filled that house up with roommates and bought another one and so on so forth. Kevin became a Real Estate agent by accident because he could not find a Realtor who could help sell his investments in a pinch so he got a license and did it himself. Before too long people started reaching out to him for advice and a Real Estate career was born. Since then Kevin has become one of Austin's most respected top producers.
