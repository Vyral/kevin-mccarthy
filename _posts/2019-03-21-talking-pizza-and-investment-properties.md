I’m starting out the day at Lakeside Pizza to enjoy two things: a fantastic slice and a quick conversation about investment properties. **Let’s start with some great Italian cuisine.**

We used our mailing list coupon (sign up and you can get one too!) for a medium cheese pizza. It was on point, and their Greek salads were also very good. I highly recommend you check it out.

Investing in a great pizza reminds me of something else—investing in real estate. I drove to a condo I’ve leased out again as an investment property, and I’d like to **share a few ways you can start your own investment property and begin making a steady, passive income:**

**1. Own a property.** Simply owning a property is a great way to become wealthy. It gives you a nest egg to sit on for later in life, and you can also turn the property you own into a rental property.

**2. Go out and buy an investment property.** There are a lot of different ways you can do this, and I recommend you reach out to me in order to find the right strategy.

**3. Partner up with people who are also looking for investment property.** I have documentation for partnership agreements and I’ve helped clients invest together. I’ve even done it myself. It limits your risk, you pay less money, and it’s a great way to get started. You’ll gain equity and build wealth.

If you’d like to get started in investing or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
