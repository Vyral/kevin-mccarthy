As we settle into 2019, I’m proud to announce that I’ve partnered with the brokerage company Maxavenue.

**This partnership is a way for me to add maximum value to my clients.** Moving forward, you’ll see some cool new features added to our maximum value home selling system and our maximum choice home buying system in order to streamline each process. I’m very excited about this partnership and what it can do for my buyers and sellers.

As far as our Austin real estate market goes, things have leveled off a bit so far this year. Supply has caught up with demand in most areas, but we shouldn’t see any significant price decreases. If anything, **this is a normalization of our market,** and we shouldn’t see as many multiple-offer situations as we’ve been seeing in the past couple years.

If you’re a seller, this means you have to work harder to get your home sold quickly and for top dollar, and that’s where our maximum value home selling system comes in!

If you have any questions about this new partnership, our Austin market, or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
