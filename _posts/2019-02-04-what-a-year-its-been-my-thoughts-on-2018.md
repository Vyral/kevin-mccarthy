The new year is almost here, but there’s still a little of 2018 left to go. I found myself thinking about everything that’s happened throughout the year—the highs, the lows, and the craziness of everything in between—and I’d like to share my thoughts with you today.

Though I switched brokers recently in 2017, in the middle of this year’s hottest season, my new brokerage was bought out by another one! It was a wild ride for a while there, **but things have thankfully smoothed out by this point.** Despite these shake-ups in my brokerage situation, I was still able to meet my goals for the year.

I hope you’ve met yours this year as well, but what are your goals for next year? Are you looking to buy a home or investment property? Now’s the time to start thinking about it.

I like to circle back to old clients of mine and help them with their new real estate endeavors. **I had the opportunity to do so with several great people this year, helping them once again achieve their goals in our market.** If you’re someone I’ve helped recently or in the past, I want to thank you for choosing me for your real estate needs. **I wouldn’t be where I am today without you,** and I’m blessed to be working with such awesome people.

I hope this upcoming year brings great new opportunities in your life, and if any of your New Year’s resolutions include buying or selling a home, be sure to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon. In the meantime, have a Happy New Year!
