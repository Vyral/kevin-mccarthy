{% include youtube.html %}<center>Today I’m sharing my three main goals for 2020.&nbsp;</center>

It’s a brand-new year and I’m already out previewing some homes. Things are going to start heating up this year, and I’m pretty excited\!&nbsp;

I left off in 2019 **[talking about goals.](https://austinvideoblog.com/now-is-the-time-to-think-about-your-goals-for-2020.html){: target="_blank"}** Heading into this year, I’ve got my own personal and professional goals written down and crystallized in my mind. I hope you had a chance to write down your goals, too.&nbsp;

**One of my big goals this year is to help 50 families move,** whether they’re renting a house, need a bigger house, want to sell a house, etc. To achieve this, I need your help. If you know anybody who may need my help in making a move this year, reach out to me. I’d love to talk to them and help them achieve their real estate goals.&nbsp;

**My second goal is to clean up my social media.** I’ve got years and years’ worth of content spread out over YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc. I want to organize it all, make sure all the links work, and get rid of whatever I no longer need.&nbsp;

**My third goal this year is to finish the classes for my broker license.** Though I’ve been doing real estate for 15 years and have 480-some transactions under my belt, it’s been on my bucket list to get that specific certification.&nbsp;

I’d also love to buy another investment property by the end of the year, but we’ll see. If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m always happy to help.
