&nbsp;

With the new year here and tax day around the corner, it’s time to file your homestead exemption if you haven’t already.

**If you have bought a house in the last year, make sure that you file the homestead exemption by April 30.**

In the next few weeks, we’ll be reaching out to make sure all of you who have bought with us last year get this filed. **You’d be surprised at the significant tax savings involved with doing so.**

On another note, if selling is in your future, now’s a good time to start getting your home ready for the spring market. We’d be happy to come take a look at your home and offer our advice on what you should do.

If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
