I’m not just here today to talk about **Austin Terrier**, a great local lunch spot—I’m also here to talk about homestead exemptions.

If you’re on my mailing list, you’ve already received a coupon for Austin Terrier. We’ve been shining the spotlight on restaurants in our area each month, and by joining our list, you can get some good deals on some great meals. **The sandwiches here are excellent, and I’ve heard the pizza is tasty as well.** And the truffle fries? *On point!*

While I wholeheartedly recommend Austin Terrier, I’m not here to simply talk about good food. **I also have some information to share about the homestead exemption deadline.**

If you’ve bought a house in the past year, you need to file for a homestead exemption before the end of April. If you bought a house in the past and are unsure if your homestead exemption was filed by the county, be sure to check—it’s surprising to see how many people have never filed for it.

We’ll always reach out to you if we see your exemption wasn’t accepted or filed, but it’s always good to be proactive. **If you want to learn how to do file for your homestead exemption, [click here for instructions.](https://www.kmatx.com/homestead-exemption){: target="_blank"}**
