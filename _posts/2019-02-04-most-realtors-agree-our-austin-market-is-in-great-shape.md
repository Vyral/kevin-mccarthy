Recently I joined my wife Kate and her co worker Ginger Carnright from Premier Nationwide Lending **to interview agents on the Realtor Bat Cruise about our Austin real estate market, and today I’m going to share some highlights from those discussions.**

Before I interviewed some of the agents on the cruise, though, I asked Kate and Ginger to share whether they knew of any special lending programs available right now. Of course, they had some great opportunities to suggest.

First, the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs is now offering a 3.75% interest rate for qualifying first-time homebuyers. This program could be an amazing opportunity for those looking to buy real estate in the near future.

With this question out of the way, I turned my attention to my fellow Realtors to get their take on current market trends. **Indu Govind of JBGoodwin Realtors was the first agent I spoke to, and in her words: “The Austin real estate market is booming.”**

And it isn’t just Indu who thinks so, the other Realtors I spoke to had similar things to say. You can check out today’s video to see their responses for yourself.

Overall, the consensus is clear: The Austin market is really good and is likely to stay that way for quite some time.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
