  When you buy new construction, you’ll have the opportunity to visit a design
  center like the one featured in today’s video. To help you understand what you
  can expect, I wanted to give you a sneak peek at what these facilities are
  like.

While some builders operate out of their own design center, most work through a shared facility. Those buying new construction will have the opportunity to browse the options available through design centers like this, which I believe to be one of the most exciting aspects of the process. I recently spent an afternoon at the Meritage Homes Design Center, myself, and brought along my camera so that I could show you exactly what to expect if or when you visit a design center yourself. If you have any other questions, would like more information, or if new construction is something you’re interested in, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon. <br>
