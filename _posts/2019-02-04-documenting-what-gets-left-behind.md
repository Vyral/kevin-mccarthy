Yesterday, I was at the Austin City Limits music festival enjoying an 80-degree day. Today I’m in Liberty Hill documenting junk items the seller of an acreage left behind in the pouring rain.

Just another day in real estate.

The buyer of this property and I had been working to close on it for the past few months, and we finally got the deal done. The owner, however, hasn’t removed all of their stuff from it. Obviously in this situation, **whatever items get left behind become the property of the new owner, but the new owner doesn’t want these items either.**

At the last minute, we had to negotiate a deposit for these items to be removed within five days, and that’s what brought me out to this property in the pouring rain—**to document an expectation of what needs to be removed.** If it’s not removed within five days, we’ll call a team of junk busters to take it away and the seller won’t get their deposit back.

I found a broken chicken coop, part of a washing machine, an old satellite dish, and a truck with no engine scattered among other items across the premises. To see what other things I found on the property, watch the video above.<br>&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about this type of situation or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.
